# Statistics Cheatsheet

Statistics concerns itself with Random Variables. Random variables express the outcomes of some random process in numbers. For example, the Random Variable X could take on the value of 1 to show that a coin flip came out heads or take on the value of 0 to show that it came out tails.

These can be characterized by their probability density functions.
